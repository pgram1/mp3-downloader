# mp3-downloader

youtube-dl and ffmpeg utility to make CDs quickly

## Instructions

- Input all the media links in order

- When done, press some random character and `Enter` to move on to the conversion stage

- Wait while conversion makes the mp3 files that are compatible with most devices

- When done **make sure you empty the autogenerated directory before reusing the script**

## Executables Needed / Dependencies

(to be placed in the same directory)

- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)

## Maintainance

Youtube-dl self-updates with the `youtube-dl -U` command. You might need to do that once in a while because youtube and other supported websites change their interface or media service.

## Disclaimer

As this project depends on two other projects, sometimes there might be issues with those projects that are unsolvable on my end.
